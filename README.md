# Hello World Xamarin

This is my first project using Xamarin Forms and C#. I wanted to add mobile development to my developer toolbelt, and already had sufficient C# knowledge, so going the route of Xamarin seemed like the logical choice.

The work completed for this project is based off of "The Complete Xamarin Developer Course: iOS And Android!", a course I purchased from Udemy.com. The course was created by Tim Buchalka, owner of The Learn Programming Academy, and is taught by Eduardo Rosas, a Xamarin-Certified Mobile Developer and Software Engineer. You can view the course specifics, as well as purchase the course, at https://www.udemy.com/share/1002vaBEIbeFdRQ3w=/
